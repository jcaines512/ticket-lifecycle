<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

<p> 
<h2>Stage 1: Intake</h2>

Access the portal, sign in, and generate a new customer ticket for testing purposes. The URL: [osTicket Link](https://localhost/osTicket/)
<br>

</p>
<p>
In this stage, a new ticket is created. Tickets can be submitted through a form or by emailing a designated ticket address. Users provide their contact information, select the topic/issue, and provide details about the problem.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Stage 2: Assignment</h2>
<p> 
After the ticket is submitted, it can be assigned to an IT professional. In our case, the ticket handling information has been adjusted for proper management. The severity level has been updated, with the Priority set to "Emergency," the SLA Plan to "SEV-A," and the Department to "System Administrators." Additionally, the ticket has been assigned to the administrator "Jane Doe" for resolution.

<p>
<h2>Stage 3: Working the Issue</h2>
<p> 
With the ticket now assigned to the relevant department and staff members, the IT team can begin working on resolving the issue. Throughout the process, any updates or changes related to the ticket can be documented in the Ticket Thread through comments. This ensures that all individuals viewing the ticket are informed about the progress and fosters effective communication among everyone involved.
</p> 
</p>
</p>
<h2>Stage 4: Resolution</h2>
<p> 
Once the issue has been successfully resolved, the ticket can be closed, causing it to transition from the Open section to the Closed section. As IT professionals, it is beneficial to browse through closed tickets as they serve as a valuable repository of solutions that can be referenced when handling open tickets. Consider it a "big library" of knowledge that aids in addressing future inquiries effectively.
